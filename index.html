      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Rob! I'm still figuring out this whole "making a webpage" thing, so either you're a friend poking to see what I've done, an instructor checking my work, or somehow managed to find your way here blindly. If it's the first, "Hi guys!" If it's the second, "Welcome!" If it's the third, "Well done, I guess?"</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from all over the place, but mostly around the Bay Area! Grew up in Burlingame, currently living in Oakland.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Games, internet, and cats! I play board games and MMOs with friends, lose hours of my life trying to figure out how the internet works, and have two cats who keep me company.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Waterslide test pilot! (apologies to Jeph Jacques)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I already told you that I live in Oakland, CA. Jeez, pay attention.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have worked menial and mindless jobs for a while, spinning my mental wheels. It's time to do something harder on my brain than my spine. And for someone who spends as much time on the internet as I do, the desire to pop the hood and figure out how it works is overwhelming.</p>
